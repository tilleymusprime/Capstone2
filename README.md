# Capstone2
Welcome to my second Capstone project.  The goal of this project is to organize and understand credit modeling data and use it to predict if a customer will have any payment problems based on the provided information.
So far, there are only 2 uploads (besides this readme).  The first is the code.  This contains all of the cleaning steps that were taken as well as all of the statistical analysis. The second sheet is the word document report.  In case there is any trouble opening the report, here is a link to it as well:

Thank you and enjoy!
